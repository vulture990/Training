# Project Scope and Timeline

## Project Overview

**Objective:** Develop a custom AI model using sensitive data with an emphasis on privacy, across two phases. Phase 1 focuses on data training with Mistral || GPT. Phase 2 involves knowledge base file training with a vector database, leveraging GPT models on Azure or AWS.

## Phase 1: Data Training with Mistral OR GPT  for the format input

### Goal of phase 1
Train a custom Model to get us to write in the format wanted

### Tasks

- **Data Preparation (Day 1):** Quick collection, anonymization, and preprocessing of data.
- **Mistral Setup - Or- GPT depeding on what LLM we end up choosing (Day 2):** Fast deployment of Mistral or GPT on a secure environment.
- **Model Training (Days 3-4):** Rapid training using selected pre-trained models and client data.
- **Model Evaluation (Day 5):** Initial testing and iteration for performance improvement.

### Timeline: 5 Days

## Phase 2: Knowledge Base File Training with Vector Database

### Goal
Enhance the AI model by incorporating a knowledge base, using a vector database for efficient retrieval.(RAG)

### Tasks

- **Knowledge Base Preparation (Day 6):** Quick assembly and preprocessing of the knowledge base.
- **Integration with Vector Database (Day 7):** Setup of a vector database and integration with the model.
- **Model Training (Day 8):** Utilizing Azure or AWS for quick training for retreival (RAG) with the knowledge base https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/fine-tuning?tabs=turbo%2Cpython&pivots=programming-language-studio
- **Deployment and Testing (Days 9-10):** Final deployment on a secure platform and testing.

### Timeline: 5 Days

## Overall Project Timeline: 10 Days

This condensed timeline is ambitious and assumes preparatory work such as data collection and preliminary discussions on model requirements have been completed. It relies on the availability of resources and the immediate readiness of technologies involved. Careful consideration should be given to ensure that the quality and security of the project are not compromised by the accelerated pace.
